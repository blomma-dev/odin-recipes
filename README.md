# odin-recipes

I am creating this website for an assignment in The Odin Project, my main goal with this particular project is to strengthen and take a moment to work on my existing HTML and CSS coding skills. This particular assignment dives back in to the bare basics of HTML, and repetition is the mother of learning.
