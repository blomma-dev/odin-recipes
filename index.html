        <h1>Odin-recipes</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Odin-recipes!</p>
        <p>This is a collection of my favourite recipes. I am creating this website for an assignment in The Odin Project, my main goal is to strengthen my existing HTML and CSS coding skills. This particular assignment dives back in to the bare basics of HTML, and repetition is the wisdom of learning.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Please note that this project is still under development and will be improved as I work on the assignment.</p>
