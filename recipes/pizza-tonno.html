    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza Tonno is a classical Italian dish with Tuna, onions and olives. Perfect for every occasion!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza dough</li>
        <li>200g tomato sauce</li>
        <li>150g grated cheese</li>
        <li>2 cans of tuna in oil</li>
        <li>1 large red onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start creating the pizza dough, or use a store-bought pizza crust. DRAIN the canned tuna and add them to the small bowl. PEEL the red onion and chop into thin rings.</li>
        <li>PRE-HEAT the oven to 200 degrees Celsius or 390 degrees Fahrenheit. DUST your work surface and rolling-pin with flour and roll out the dough until you've reached a round pizza crust. </li>
        <li>TRANSFER the crust to the baking tray lined with parchment paper. COVER the pizza crust with passata and divide the red onion rings and tuna over the crust.</li>
        <li>DIVIDE a package of grated mozzarella (150 gram) over the pizza and season with pepper and salt. </li>
        <li>BAKE the pizza tonno for about 15 to 20 minutes, depending on your oven and thickness of the pizza crust. TRANSFER to a large plate or board and divide into pieces.</li>
        <li>Serve with a delicious garlic sauce if you like and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
